# Multi-Tenancy

A single Medha backend can serve multiple tenants, applications, or query languages simultaneously. Each **collection name** is a fully isolated namespace — different vector spaces, different entries, different thresholds.

This page covers four common patterns:

1. [Per-application isolation](#per-application-isolation) — multiple query languages on one backend
2. [Per-customer isolation](#per-customer-isolation) — SaaS: one namespace per customer
3. [Shared embedder](#shared-embedder) — one model in memory, many `Medha` instances
4. [Concurrent fan-out](#concurrent-fan-out) — parallel searches across tenants with `asyncio.gather`
5. [Per-tenant stats](#per-tenant-stats) — independent hit-rate monitoring per tenant
6. [Per-tenant backend selection](#per-tenant-backend-selection) — trial vs. paid tier isolation

## Per-Application Isolation

Two applications share the same backend but use different collection names. Their caches are completely independent — a query cached for the SQL app is never returned by the Cypher app.

```python
from medha import Medha, Settings
from medha.embeddings.fastembed_adapter import FastEmbedAdapter

shared_settings = Settings(backend_type="memory")
shared_embedder = FastEmbedAdapter()

# SQL analytics app
medha_sql = Medha(
    collection_name="app_sql_analytics",
    embedder=shared_embedder,
    settings=shared_settings,
)
await medha_sql.start()
await medha_sql.store("How many users are there?", "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users")

# Cypher graph explorer
medha_cypher = Medha(
    collection_name="app_cypher_graph",
    embedder=shared_embedder,
    settings=shared_settings,
)
await medha_cypher.start()
await medha_cypher.store("How many Person nodes?", "MATCH (p:Person) RETURN COUNT(p)")

# Same question in each app returns app-specific results
hit_sql    = await medha_sql.search("How many users are there?")
hit_cypher = await medha_cypher.search("How many users are there?")

print(hit_sql.generated_query)     # SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users
print(hit_cypher.generated_query)  # None — no match in the Cypher collection
```

---

## Per-Customer Isolation

In a SaaS platform each customer has their own data schema and question vocabulary. Namespacing collection names with the customer ID keeps each tenant's cache completely isolated — even when they ask the same question.

```python
TENANTS = {
    "tenant_acme": {
        "pairs": [
            ("How many users?",      "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM acme_users"),
            ("Total revenue",        "SELECT SUM(amount) FROM acme_invoices"),
        ],
        "settings": Settings(backend_type="memory", score_threshold_semantic=0.82),
    },
    "tenant_globex": {
        "pairs": [
            ("How many users?",      "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM globex_accounts"),  # same question, different table!
            ("Total revenue",        "SELECT SUM(revenue) FROM globex_deals"),
        ],
        "settings": Settings(backend_type="memory", score_threshold_semantic=0.87),
    },
}

shared_embedder = FastEmbedAdapter()
instances: dict[str, Medha] = {}

for tenant_id, config in TENANTS.items():
    m = Medha(
        collection_name=tenant_id,
        embedder=shared_embedder,
        settings=config["settings"],
    )
    await m.start()
    for question, sql in config["pairs"]:
        await m.store(question, sql)
    instances[tenant_id] = m

# Same question, different SQL per tenant
for tenant_id, m in instances.items():
    hit = await m.search("How many users do we have?")
    print(f"[{tenant_id}] {hit.generated_query}")
# [tenant_acme]   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM acme_users
# [tenant_globex] SELECT COUNT(*) FROM globex_accounts
```

---

## Shared Embedder

Loading an embedding model costs ~200 MB. `FastEmbedAdapter` is stateless and safe to share across multiple `Medha` instances — you pay the loading cost once regardless of tenant count.

```python
N_TENANTS = 5
one_embedder = FastEmbedAdapter()  # loaded once

tenants = []
for i in range(N_TENANTS):
    m = Medha(
        collection_name=f"tenant_{i:03d}",
        embedder=one_embedder,           # same object reused
        settings=Settings(backend_type="memory"),
    )
    await m.start()
    await m.store(
        f"How many records in tenant {i}?",
        f"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tenant_{i:03d}_records",
    )
    tenants.append(m)
```

---

## Concurrent Fan-Out

Because Medha is async-native, N concurrent tenant searches run in parallel and complete in roughly the time of a single search.

```python
import asyncio

# Fan out searches across all tenants simultaneously
results = await asyncio.gather(*[
    m.search(f"Revenue for customer group {i}")
    for i, m in enumerate(tenants)
])
```

---

## Per-Tenant Stats

Each `Medha` instance tracks its own stats independently. Use this to monitor per-tenant hit rates and identify tenants with low cache coverage.

```python
for tenant_id, m in instances.items():
    stats = await m.stats()
    print(f"[{tenant_id}] hit_rate={stats.hit_rate:.0%}  requests={stats.total_requests}")
```

See [Observability](observability.md) for the full `CacheStats` API.

---

## Per-Tenant Backend Selection

A common pattern is to use `backend_type="memory"` for **trial tenants** (zero infrastructure cost) and promote to a persistent backend on conversion.

```python
# Trial tenant — pure-Python InMemoryBackend, no infrastructure needed
trial_settings = Settings(backend_type="memory")
medha_trial = Medha("trial_tenant_001", embedder=shared_embedder, settings=trial_settings)

# Paid tenant — persistent Qdrant backend
paid_settings = Settings(backend_type="qdrant", qdrant_mode="docker", qdrant_host="localhost")
medha_paid = Medha("paid_tenant_acme", embedder=shared_embedder, settings=paid_settings)
```

| `backend_type` | Extra deps | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `"memory"` | none (default) | Ephemeral tenants, CI, trial accounts |
| `"qdrant"` | `medha-archai[qdrant]` | Production — Docker or Cloud |
| `"pgvector"` | `medha-archai[pgvector]` | Teams already running PostgreSQL |
| `"elasticsearch"` | `medha-archai[elasticsearch]` | Teams on the Elastic stack |
| `"lancedb"` | `medha-archai[lancedb]` | Serverless / embedded deployments |

---

## Tenant Lifecycle

When a tenant is deactivated, close their `Medha` instance and drop their collection.

```python
# Deactivate
await medha_tenant.close()

# Delete data (Qdrant docker/cloud)
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
client = QdrantClient(url="http://localhost:6333")
client.delete_collection("tenant_trial_001")
```

With `backend_type="memory"` closing the instance already releases all data.
