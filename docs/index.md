# Medha

> **Stop paying LLMs to answer the same question twice.**

Medha is an async Python semantic cache library for AI Text-to-Query systems. It sits between your application and the LLM, intercepting questions and returning pre-cached SQL, Cypher, or GraphQL queries by matching semantic intent — no LLM call required for repeated patterns.

LLMs regenerate the same structured queries thousands of times per day. Medha intercepts before the LLM call and returns cached results in under a millisecond for repeated patterns. Works with SQL, Cypher, GraphQL, or any structured query language. Drop it in front of any LLM and watch your inference costs drop.

## Features

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-layers:{ .lg .middle } **Waterfall Search**

    ---

    Five progressive tiers, from sub-millisecond L1 cache to full semantic similarity. Each tier only activates when the previous one misses, keeping average latency minimal.

-   :material-database:{ .lg .middle } **9 Vector Backends**

    ---

    In-memory for development, Qdrant, pgvector, Elasticsearch, VectorChord, Chroma, Weaviate, Redis Stack, Azure AI Search, and LanceDB for production.

-   :material-chip:{ .lg .middle } **4 Embedding Providers**

    ---

    Local ONNX via FastEmbed (no API key, no cost) or cloud providers: OpenAI, Cohere, and Gemini. Swap providers without losing cached data.

-   :material-rocket-launch:{ .lg .middle } **Production Ready**

    ---

    Per-entry TTL, bulk ingestion, pattern and exact invalidation, hit-rate metrics, latency percentiles, and Prometheus-compatible observability.

## Quickstart

```python
import asyncio
from medha import Medha, Settings
from medha.embeddings.fastembed_adapter import FastEmbedAdapter

async def main():
    embedder = FastEmbedAdapter()  # local ONNX, no API key
    settings = Settings(backend_type="memory")

    async with Medha("demo", embedder=embedder, settings=settings) as cache:
        await cache.store(
            "How many active users do we have?",
            "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE active = true",
        )

        hit = await cache.search("Count of active users")
        print(hit.generated_query)   # SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE active = true
        print(hit.strategy)          # SearchStrategy.SEMANTIC_MATCH
        print(f"Confidence: {hit.confidence:.0%}")  # e.g. Confidence: 94%

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Architecture

Medha uses a five-tier waterfall search. Each tier is only reached when the previous one misses:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Q[Question] --> L1[L1 Cache]
    L1 -->|HIT| R[Return Result]
    L1 -->|MISS| TM[Template Match]
    TM -->|HIT| R
    TM -->|MISS| EV[Exact Vector\nscore ≥ 0.99]
    EV -->|HIT| R
    EV -->|MISS| SM[Semantic Match\nscore ≥ 0.85]
    SM -->|HIT| R
    SM -->|MISS| FZ[Fuzzy Match\noptional]
    FZ -->|HIT| R
    FZ -->|MISS| LLM[Call LLM]
    LLM --> ST[Store in Medha]
    ST --> R
```

---

!!! tip "Performance"

    The hit rate is defined as:

    $$\text{hit\_rate} = \frac{\text{total\_hits}}{\text{total\_hits} + \text{total\_misses}}$$

    Even a 50% hit rate halves LLM costs for repetitive query workloads. In practice, production Text-to-Query systems see hit rates of 70–90% because users repeatedly ask structurally equivalent questions.
