# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

*   Using welcoming and inclusive language
*   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
*   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
*   Focusing on what is best for the community
*   Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
*   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
*   Public or private harassment
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without their explicit permission
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or friendly community

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.  This includes, but is not limited to, project repositories, issue trackers, chat rooms, social media, and in-person meetings.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy of the reporter of the incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Enforcement Guidelines to determine the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction:**  For minor transgressions, such as unintentional use of offensive language, the maintainer may issue a gentle reminder of the Code of Conduct and ask the individual to revise their communication.

2. **Warning:** For more serious or repeated violations, the maintainer may issue a formal warning stating that further violations could result in a temporary or permanent ban.

3. **Temporary Ban:**  For severe violations, the maintainer may temporarily ban an individual from interacting with the project for a specified period.

4. **Permanent Ban:**  For extremely severe or repeated violations, the maintainer may permanently ban an individual from interacting with the project.
